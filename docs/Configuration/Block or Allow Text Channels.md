# Block Or Allow Text Channels

### Description

This is a highly configurable part of the bot, we allow you change the behavior of a list of text channels. (block or allow list)

When behavior is set to "block" the list functions as a Block list, preventing votekick command from being used in the list of channels.

When behavior is set to "allow" the list functions as an Allow list, allowing the votekick command to be used in EXCLUSIVELY the list of channels you add to the list.


### Usage

`/vk-add-text-channel <#channel>`

`/vk-remove-text-channel <#channel>`

`/vk-toggle-text`

(toggle behavior between block and allow list)
