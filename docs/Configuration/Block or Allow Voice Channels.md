# Block Or Allow Voice Channels

### Description

This is a highly configurable part of the bot, we allow you change the behavior of a list of voice channels. (block or allow list)

When behavior is set to "block" the list functions as a Block list, preventing votekick command from being used against anyone in a blocked voice channel.

When behavior is set to "allow" the list functions as an Allow list, allowing the votekick command to be used EXCLUSIVELY in the list of voice channels you add to the list.


### Usage

`/vk-add-voice-channel <#channel>`

`/vk-remove-voice-channel <#channel>`

`/vk-toggle-voice`

(toggle behavior between block and allow list)
